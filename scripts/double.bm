Read in a single digit number and output it's double
Initial version only works if the number is 0 thru 4

, Input number #0 now has the ascii value of number so we need to subtract 48 from it to get actual number
------------------------------------------------
[->++<] Loop: Subtract one from #0 and add two to #1
> Move forward to the cell that contains the doubled amount
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Convert back to ASCII code
. Output result
